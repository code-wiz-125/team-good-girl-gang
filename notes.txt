March-6 Entry:

Hi everyone! I'm pumped to start coding!

I just want to remind you that if you are having trouble starting, 
Kody provided a guide for us and what we need to incorporate onto our pages. 
You can find this guide in the Classroom under the post titled 
"YWeb Instructor posted a new material: Team Project 1" posted on March 3rd. 
If you are still having trouble, please let me know!


Below is what everyone has been assigned:
