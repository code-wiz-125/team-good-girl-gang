March 7 Entry:

Hey guys, just a heads up - in the stylesheet you will see sections for page's CSS labeled with comments. 
Within your page's CSS section, I have added a class for your page's header so you can add the image you want as your header.
For example, the header class for my page is .header , for leadership page the class is .leadership-header ...ETC.

Let me know if you have questions!
